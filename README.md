## GridX Overview

#### **A fast rendering, well modularized and plugin architecture based Grid.**

Besides supporting a rich set of popular features, GridX is optimized and extremely capable of supporting huge dataset(e.g.[larger than millions of rows]()).

GridX is consisted of:

* A compact and lightweight core
* A flexible plugin machinery with comprehensive module life-cycle and conflict management
* A rich and extend-able set of modules which can be loaded on demand.

GridX is available under [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/) [CLA](http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla) with the same [BSD/AFLv2 license] (http://dojotoolkit.org/license)
